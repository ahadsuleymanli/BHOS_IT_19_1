## What is Academic Misconduct
Academic misconduct can take many forms, including
cheating, unauthorized possession of exams, lab
materials, or uncited usage of writing or code that
was not written by the student him/herself.  
Many students don’t fully understand plagiarism so
here's the short of it:

## What is plagiarism
Plagiarism is using another person’s work without
acknowledgment, making it appear to be one’s own.  
• Any ideas, words, pictures, code, or other source must be
acknowledged in a citation that gives credit to the
source.  
• This is true no matter where the material comes from,
including the internet, other student’s work, unpublished
materials, or oral sources.  
• Intentional and unintentional instances of plagiarism
are considered instances of academic misconduct.  
• It is the responsibility of the student submitting the
work in question to know, understand, and comply with
this policy.

## Examples of conduct that can lead to unintentional plagiarism related to this courses asignments
• When struggling with a coding asignment looking at someone else's code  
• Searching online or otherwise for complete solutions to the problem  
• Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course’s own lessons
and integrate into your own work  
• Any other situation where with or without your knowledge, accidentally or not yours and someone elses work is copied and modified from the other

when asking for help, 
you may show your code to others, 
but you may not view theirs
```

## Consequences of academic misconduct
While plagiarism detection tools have not yet been inplemented at BHOS, at future dates it will be.  
As in any respectable university plagiarism is dealt with harshly where repeated instances eventually lead to being expelled from the university.  

## Benefits of adhering to good academic conduct
In any respectable professional or academic environments most of the time plagiarism happens accidentally.  
Accidental academic misconduct cannot be told apart from the intentional one and one's academic credibility can be ruined for life after a few repeated instances.  
Learning how to navigate your academic life's challenges without allowing for plagiarism is an important skill one needs to develop.  
Being able to talk with your proffessors and peers in an honest way wihtout the fear of being judged is a good practice to make early on.
