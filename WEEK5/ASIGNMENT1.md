## Asignment1
***Stacks are a resizable data structure where last element placed onto the stack is intended to be taken out and used first for given processing task, stacks are sometimes called LIFO queues.***  
***Given the stack example code given:***
1. reimplement the resize function without using realloc(). Make sure to free unused dynamically allocated memory.
2. In real world you don't want your data structures to start consuming larger and larger amounds of memory,  
therefore when such a data structure is no longer as full (eg. a quarter of the capacity) shrink down the allocated memory to half.
