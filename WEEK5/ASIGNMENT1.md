## Asignment1
***Given the stack example code given:***
1. reimplement the resize function without using realloc(). Make sure to free unused dynamically allocated memory.
2. In real world you don't want your data structures to start consuming larger and larger amounds of memory,  
therefore when such a data structure is no longer as full (eg. a quarter of the capacity) shrink down the allocated memory to half.
