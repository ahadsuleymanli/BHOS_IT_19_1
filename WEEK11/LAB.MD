## PART2
Since all leaf nodes will exist in this binary tree, ie. it is a ***perfect tree***,  
it is relatively easy to parse it and build a tree data structure out of it. 
Build a binary tree from an input file and find the largest sum on the Largest-Sum-Path  
from the root to one of the leaf nodes.  
Modify your source code from WEEK10 and use it as a library for solving the binary tree for largest sum to a leaf.
